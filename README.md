# **fractalTree** *java* implementation with *swing*
Through inheritance and method overriding, it is possible to add new functionalities to the tree, as shown here.

List of functionalities:
* standard fractal tree : *JFractalTreePanel2*
* gradual tree level by level : *JGradualFractalTreePanel2*
* branch by branch as drawn in reality by the recursive algorithm : *JGradualSpiralTreePanel*

I hope you'll enjoy it!
